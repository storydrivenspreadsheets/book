The easy and hard parts of data and spreadsheets
***


In computation, there's only the easy and the hard. Easy is everything that can be automated.

And the hard things are everything that can't.


Easy:

- Calculations, aggregations, formulas, transformations.

Hard:

- Is this death a homicide?
- Is this suspect mentally ill?
- Was this police shooting justified?
- Is this James Smith the same as this other James Smith?
- Is this campaign expenditure suspicious?
- Is there a story in the data?
