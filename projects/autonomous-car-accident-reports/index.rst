hello

    For every million miles driven, self-driving vehicles had 9.1 crashes, compared to just 1.9 for regular vehicles, according to a report released Thursday by the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. In other words, self-driving cars were five times as likely to crash as conventional ones, and their passengers were four times as likely to get injured (with 3.29 injuries per million miles, compared to only .77 injuries in regular cars). Self-driving cars were also rear-ended 50% more often than traditional vehicles.
